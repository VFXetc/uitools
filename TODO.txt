- `wait_until_true(func, *args, **kwargs, timeout=None)` for the trampoline.

- figure out where "QMainWindowLayout::count: ?" is coming from Maya

- convert trampoline into a class:

  class Trampoline(object):
    def __init__(self, func=None, call_in_main_thread=None)

  def trampoline(func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    return Trampoline(func, *args, **kwargs)

- integrate into the Maya event loop
  - I think it is running its own set of events/loops on top of Qt, so it
    isn't entirely cool to be jamming our own code into the Qt loop
