This package is a grab-bag of tools for building Qt-based Python user interfaces. It includes:

* box layout shortcuts
* a MVC role registry
* a thread trampoline to simplify testing
* functions to call or defer another function in the "main" thread
* XPath-like querying of object graphs

[Read the docs](http://uitools.readthedocs.org/), and good luck!
